# slashbot

slashbot is a shitty discord bot written using disnake, based on my previous
bot, [badbot](https://github.com/saultyevil/badbot). It is designed to work
in only a few servers, hence there are some hardcoded IDs in here.

## Features

Here are some of the main features

* Markov Chain sentence generation (learns from the server)
* Embed a YouTube search
* Set reminders
* Connect to voice to stream audio
* Generate sentences from God's temple
* Post images from rule34.xxx
* Get the news headlines
* Check the weather and forecast
* Ask Stephen Wolfram a question

## Requirements

Python 3.8+ is required. All other requirements are in requirements.txt, and
can be installed as such,

```bash
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
